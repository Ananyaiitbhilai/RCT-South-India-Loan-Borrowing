1) The ipynb notebooks are well-commented and have answers in the markdown cells are present along with the code. 
2) Merge.csv - is the merged dataset (Data processing - Last question)
4) model_summary_result{1/2/3}.txt are having model summary for OLS regression for the part (b,d,e) in Ananlysis section
5) The png image saved in the answer to the last part in Ananlysis section
6) I have used the pipeline: Data -> imputing nan with median -> outlier removal -> some other pre-processing if required (would be mentioned in the code what pre-processing I had carried out apart from the previous two which is always common) ananlysis
7) I have stated my assumption within the code or markdown and my rationale behind carrying out a certain step
8) Utils.py contains a custom function I wrote about getting info about a dataframe
9) 2 ipynb notebooks for 2 sections
10) Create a conda venv and intall the dependencies in reuirements.txt with python version = 3.8, Set your python kernel to the venv so to run ioynb notebooks, However all the outputs are present within the notebooks.
11) There are 2 pdf files which are the pdf version of ipynb file for more readability. 
12) 2 .dta files and treatmemt_status.csv were the already provided datasets
